# Global Claude Code Instructions

## Code Intelligence and Navigation
Prefer LSP over Grep/Glob/Read for code navigation:
- `goToDefinition` / `goToImplementation` to jump to source
- `findReferences` to see all usages across the codebase
- `workspaceSymbol` to find where something is defined
- `documentSymbol` to list all symbols in a file
- `hover` for type info without reading the file
- `incomingCalls` / `outgoingCalls` for call hierarchy

Before renaming or changing a function signature, use `findReferences` to find all call sites first.
Use Grep/Glob only for text/pattern searches (comments, strings, config values) where LSP doesn't help.
After writing or editing code, check LSP diagnostics before moving on.

## Browser Automation
Use `playwright-cli` for browser automation tasks. Run `playwright-cli --help`
to see available commands. Prefer headless mode (default) unless a visible
browser is explicitly needed.
